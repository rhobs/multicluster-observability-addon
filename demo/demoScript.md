# Demo: Multicluster Observability AddOn
@Douglas: run the introduction

Welcome to the demo of multicluster-observability-addon (aka MCOA). The MCOA is an addon for the Open Cluster Management project. Red Hat has its own distribution of this project, called Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (aka ACM), which supports architectures where a fleet of clusters is controlled by a single hub cluster.

The goal of the MCOA is to configure a fleet of spoke clusters to collect and forward observability signals to a configurable set of stores. It achieves this by leveraging APIs and Operators already present in the OpenShift Platform clusters.

In this demo, we will leverage the MCOA to collect and send:

- Metrics to the hub cluster using Prometheus Agent.
- Logs to cloudwatch and to an instance of Loki running on the hub cluster using the `ClusterLogForwarder`.
- Traces to an instance of Tempo running on the hub cluster using the `OpenTelemetryCollector`.

**Disclaimer**: for this demo we have already pre-provisioned both the hub and spoke clusters, connected them, and deployed some configuration for the stores. However, all the steps we just mentioned are also described in the README that exists on the demo folder of this project.

## 1. Install multicluster-observability-addon
@Douglas: explain the installation of the addon.

First, we are going to install the addon-manager on the hub cluster. The process of installing the manager on the hub cluster is quite simple. We just have to run:

RUN:
```bash
make addon-deploy
```

This command will:

- create RBAC resources necessary for the manager,
- the manager Deployment,
- and a resource called `ClusterManagementAddOn` which contains some defaults that will be used by the manager when installing the addon on a spoke cluster.

-- More detail beginning --
** SHOW `ClusterManagementAddOn` with `oc get ClusterManagementAddOn multicluster-observability-addon -o yaml` **

The `ClusterManagementAddOn` contains a list of resources that can be used to configure the addon deployment in each spoke cluster. The addon supports:  `addondeploymentconfigs`, `configmaps`, `secrets`, `clusterlogforwarders`, and `opentelemetrycollectors`..
-- More detail end --

Now that we have deployed the manager it's time to configure our signals collectors.

## 2. Manage observability signals across spoke clusters

### 2.1 Signal configuration
@Israel: run the configuration

As previously mentioned MCOA uses APIs familiar to the single OCP cluster use case, to achieve it's goals.
This means that, for instance, if we want to configure log forwarding for our fleet then have to create a `ClusterLogForwarder` that will be used as a template to configure `ClusterLogForwarder` on the spoke clusters.

With in mind, for the demo we will:

- For metrics not need to create any resource as the metrics deployment nowadays re-uses some the infrastructure already deployed by MCO;

- For logs we will deploy a `ClusterLogForwarder` that is configured to forward all logs to CloudWatch and infrastructure logs to Loki;

- For traces we will deploy an `OpenTelemetryCollector` that is configured to forward traces to another `OpenTelemetryCollector` hosted in the hub cluster which will forward traces to Tempo;

For logs we also create a configmap that will store which authentication methods should be used against each store. For instance,

- For CloudWatch we will want to use static authentication;

- For Loki we will want to use mTLS;

MCOA is able to consume these configmaps and generate the necessary secrets for the different signals to interact with each store.

For this demo we will deploy these configurations using a helm chart. To make the demo swift, we've pre-defined the values in the values.yaml file `demo/addon-config/values.yaml`

So now if we enable the `--dry-run` flag we can see the resources that will be created.

RUN `helm upgrade --install addon-config demo/addon-config/ --dry-run`

@Joao go through logging resources

As previously mentioned our `ClusterLogForwarder` is configured to forward logs to both CloudWatch and the Loki instance we have running on the hub cluster. Notice that we have set to `PLACEHOLDER` all the fields that will be overwriten with cluster specific information by MCOA when installing the addon on a spoke cluster. In this case, the `url` of the Loki instance, and the secret name that will be used for the communication.

We also create a configmap with the mapping between the signal store and the authentication method. This will signal MCOA that it needs to provision secrets for these communications.

@Israel go through tracing resources

In the case of traces, we configure an OpenTelemetry Collector instance that can receive telemetry data from different sources like OTLP and Jaeger receivers. In the case of the exporters, note that for the `otlp` exporter we don't specify any configuration. The endpoint will be populated by MCOA.

Finally, we can now deploy these resouces. Notice that, these resources only need to be configured once, as they will only serve as a template for the different installations to generate the final manifests that will land on the spoke clusters. This not only makes the configuration uniform across the whole fleet but also makes it easy for administrators to update their configuration as they only have to modify it in one place.

RUN `helm upgrade --install addon-config demo/addon-config/`

### 2.2 Enable the addon for spoke clusters
@Joao Run through the instalation

Now that we have deployed the configuration for the addon its time to finally install the addon on the spoke clusters.
The process of installing an addon on a cluster is quite trivial, we only need to create, in the namespace of the spoke cluster, a resource called `ManagedClusterAddOn` and give it the name `multicluster-observability-addon`. `ManagedClusterAddOn` contains a list of resources that will be used by the manager to configure the addon deployment on the spoke cluster.

For this demo we will install the addon using a helm chart. As before we've pre-defined the values in the values.yaml file to facilitate the demo `demo/addon-install/values.yaml`

So now if we enable the `--dry-run` flag we can see the resources that will be created.

RUN `helm upgrade --install addon-install demo/addon-install/ --dry-run`

Looking at the `ManagedClusterAddOn` resouce;

@Joao go through the logging resources

For the logging configuration we will use:
- The authentication configmap called `logging-auth` which has the mapping between the log stores on `ClusterLogForwarder` and their authentication methods;
- A configmap with the loki store URL, specific to the spoke cluster;
- A configmap that will contain the CA, of the loki store;
- And finally it's not on the list because if you remember it was a default on the `ClusterManagementAddOn` resource, but the `ClusterLogForwarder` template instance created before will also be used for configuration.

@Israel go through tracing resources

For tracing side, the fields to configure are:
- The `OpenTelemetryCollector` template instance, that similar to the `ClusterLogForwarder`, was created before and will also be used for configuration;
- And last but not least, a configmap with the endpoints to use for the exporters (in this case, the URL to the OpenTelemetry Collector instance from the hub cluster)

Finally, we can now install the addon.

RUN `helm upgrade --install addon-install demo/addon-install/`

Once this finishes running the manager will reconcile the resources we just created and it will create a resource called `ManifestsWorks`, in the namespace of the spoke cluster. This resource will contain a list of Kubernetes resources in YAML format that will be deployed to the spoke cluster by an agent running on the cluster, the agent was installed on the spoke cluster when we imported it to the hub.

We can look at the `ManifestsWorks` created by running:

RUN `oc -n spoke-1 get manifestworks addon-multicluster-observability-addon-deploy-0 -o yaml`

Now let's go through what's being installed on the spoke cluster:

- Metrics

@Douglas: go through the resources being installed.

For the metrics collection we are installing:

- A `Deployment` with Prometheus in agent mode.
- A `ConfigMap` to instruct this Prometheus Agent to federate metrics from the Cluster Monitoring Operator's Prometheus, apply an allowlist, and remote write them to Observatorium in the Hub.
- A `Secret` with the TLS certificates needed to authenticate with Observatorium in the Hub.
- A `Secret` with the CA certificate to verify the identity of the Observatorium instance.

- Logs

@Joao describe what's being installed

For the logs we are installing:

- A `Subscription` and `OperatorGroup` to install the cluster-logging-operator;
- Two secrets for secure communication, one for Cloudwatch and one for Loki;
- Finally, `ClusterLogging` and `ClusterLogForwarder` to enable the collection and forwarding of logs to the stores mentioned;

- Traces

@Israel describe what's being installed

In the case of the OTEL Collector we can see it was deployed in the spoke cluster. If we check the OTEL Collector configuration (`oc -n spoke-otel get pods -o yaml`) we will see the endpoint and the certificates populated in the exporter.

Now let's jump into the spoke cluster to see if the different signal collectors are running correctly:

First, Prometheus Agent

RUN `oc -n open-cluster-management-addon-observability get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/component=metrics-agent`

Second, Vector

RUN `oc -n openshift-logging get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/component=collector`

Third, OTEL Collector

RUN `oc -n spoke-otelcol get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/component=opentelemetry-collector`

## 3. Validate with Grafana

Great! Now let's jump into a grafana instance running on the hub cluster to see a dashboard where we can see all the 3 signals

RUN `oc -n grafana-operator get route grafana-route`

**Note: user: `root` password: `secret`**

For this demo we deployed a workload that would generate all the 3 signals. This workload is running on a namespace called `openshift-mcoa-demo-workload`

- First we have the total amount of container memory being used on the namespace.
- Second we have a visual representation of the logs being produced by the containers on the namespace, and the actuall logs.
- Third we have a set of traces produced by a pod running on the namespace.

## 4. Takeaways

To conclude MCOA in it's current state was the result of a working group that developed this dev-preview in a sprint.
However, we can look forward and see what features MCOA will enables for the Red Hat ACM Story:

- Multi-signal fleet Observability through a single-pane UI
    - This means that configured signal stores can then be queried from a single-plane UI.
- Customer-driven composition
    - This means flexibility in per signal export addressed in single cluster will be mirrored in the multi-cluster approach
- Support for varied OCP topologies
    - Profiles developed for special single cluster cases (e.g. SNO, MicroShift) can be reused in a fleet with zero cost;
